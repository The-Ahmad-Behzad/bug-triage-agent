Semester Project Deliverables

Course: Fundamentals of Software Project Management

Deadline: November 30, 2025, 11:59 PM.

Total Marks: 15

This project consists of three graded deliverables. All teams must
submit and present the final integrated work.

Overview of the Project

Each group will design, develop, and demonstrate a working AI Agent
System that interacts using a Supervisor--Worker (Registry)
architecture. The project focuses on both project management
documentation and technical implementation, reflecting real-world
software project practices.

Project Deliverables (3 Components)

1.  Project Report (30%)

Submit a professionally compiled report including the following
sections:

Section Required Content

Project Overview & Objectives Clear description of problem and goals.

Project Management Artifacts Updated WBS, schedule (Gantt), cost
estimate, risk plan, quality plan.

System Design & Architecture Architecture diagram, module/class design,
data flow, agent communication model.

Memory Strategy Short-Term and Long-Term Memory plan for the agent.

API Contract JSON request--response format with sample inputs and
outputs.

Integration Plan How your agent interacts with the Supervisor system.

Progress & Lessons Learned Challenges faced and how they were addressed.

Format: PDF (10--20 pages max, concise and clear).

2.  Code and Working Prototype (50%)

Submit a functioning implementation of your agent.

Requirements Description

Working AI Agent Fully functional and responds per JSON contract.

Deployment HTTP API preferred, or a runnable script with instructions.

Communication Agent must communicate with Supervisor/Registry structure.

Logging & Health Check The system should return a status response when
requested.

Integration Test Show that your agent can be called externally and
return correct outputs.

Submission: Source code + instructions to run (README) + demo recording
(optional but recommended).

3.  Presentation & Live Demonstration (20%)

Each group will present in the final sessions.

Component Description

Slides Project overview, architecture, and workflow summary.

Live Demo Show the agent responding to real-time requests.

Team Participation Every member must contribute during Q&A.

Time Limit: 8--10 minutes.

Mark Distribution Rubric (100%)

Deliverable Component / Criteria Marks (%)

Excellent (A) Good (B) Satisfactory (C) Poor (D/F)

1.  Project Report (30%)

Project Overview & Objectives 3 Clear, concise, and compelling
description of problem and goals. Mostly clear with minor ambiguity.
Some clarity but lacks depth or precision. Unclear or missing overview.

Project Management Artifacts (WBS, Gantt, Cost, Risk, Quality) 7
Comprehensive, realistic, and consistent PM artifacts. Mostly complete;
minor inconsistencies. Partial or outdated information. Major sections
missing or incorrect.

System Design & Architecture 6 Detailed, well-structured diagrams and
communication model. Functional but missing one or two details. Minimal
or unclear diagrams. Absent or irrelevant design.

Memory Strategy 4 Sound and technically appropriate memory strategy
(short/long-term). Mostly clear; minor technical gaps. Vague or
partially correct. Missing or incorrect approach.

API Contract 3 Complete JSON schema with accurate examples. Small
omissions or unclear notation. Incomplete or unclear contract. Missing
or incorrect.

Integration Plan 3 Clearly explains Supervisor--Agent interaction and
protocols. Mostly clear, lacks full detail. General plan only, lacks
specifics. Absent or infeasible.

Progress & Lessons Learned 3 Deep reflection on challenges, solutions,
and learning. Some reflection with minor gaps. Basic description,
limited insight. None provided.

Report Format & Professionalism 1 Polished layout, consistent
formatting, concise writing. Minor format or grammar issues.
Disorganized or unclear. Poorly formatted or incomplete.

2.  Code & Working Prototype (50%)

Functionality 15 Fully functional system; meets all requirements. Mostly
functional; minor bugs. Partially working; some missing features.
Non-functional or incomplete.

Integration with Supervisor/Registry 10 Seamless and correct
communication between components. Works with minor issues. Inconsistent
or limited integration. Fails to integrate.

Code Quality & Documentation 8 Well-structured, modular, and clearly
documented. Generally good; some redundancy or unclear naming. Poor
organization or limited comments. Disorganized or undocumented.

Deployment & Execution 7 Easy to deploy/run with clear setup
instructions. Some issues but mostly functional. Requires manual fixes
or unclear instructions. Cannot be executed.

Logging & Health Check 5 Detailed, consistent status responses and logs.
Basic logs, minor inconsistencies. Minimal or unclear logging. Missing
or incorrect checks.

Integration Testing & Validation 5 Comprehensive test cases with valid
outputs. Limited testing but functional. Few tests; limited validation.
No testing or failed results.

3.  Presentation & Demonstration (20%)

Presentation Slides 5 Professional, visually clear, and logically
structured. Minor formatting or content gaps. Basic or unappealing
visuals. Disorganized or incomplete slides.

Live Demonstration 8 Smooth, successful live demo showing all core
features. Works with small issues. Partial demo or minor errors. Demo
fails or not presented.

Team Participation 4 All members contribute effectively during Q&A. Most
members contribute; minor imbalance. Unequal participation. One or few
members dominate or absent.

Delivery & Communication 3 Clear, confident, well-timed delivery (8--10
min). Slightly over/under time; minor delivery issues. Unclear
explanation or time mismanaged. Unprepared or poor communication.
